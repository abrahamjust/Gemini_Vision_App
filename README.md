# A basic app that can 'see' images and analyze them - powered by Gemini AI

Utilising the power of APIs, I have created this app that can 'see' images and then analyze them based on the user prompts.
The analysis is done by Google's GEMINI AI, which is powerful enough to 'see' images and analyze them. Gemini AI has been included in this project using the GEMINI API.

The app is a work in progress and improvements and added functionality will be added in the near future.
If you have any ideas, please feel free to contribute or reach out to me.
